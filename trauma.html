        <span>;-0 one of my type professors in college wanted us to put ourselves on a line between a crystal goblet or golden chalice aka minimalism vs maximalism. i got mad bc i sorted myself sorta in the middle bc i CAN do both and i got called out and told to move further to the maximal side. but now look at me, i mean who was i kidding ??? maximalism all the way. :~) don't be a coward, be a socialist. >:-) when i was a kid i wanted to be a spider scientist, but then i took biology in high school and said no thx ;^o in this house we are nice to each other <:~) </span>

      <p>trauma center was a gallery show in collaboration with <a href="https://www.danielledinstman.com/" class="link">dani dinstman</a> centered around processing trauma through confrontation and black comedy. our show was covered in the online art magazine <a href="https://www.squinchmag.com/gallery-5/2018/8/20/gallery-5-show-allows-visitors-to-confront-their-traumas" class="link">squinch</a>.</p>
      <p>so the artful parody of a pediatrician's office is nothing new. but here's our fresh take on it. the through line of our waiting room is the pseudo-aid often offered to emotionally abused people. like 'have you tried ginger tea?' like who is that helping? not i. this took form in motivation-style posters and serene nature videos projected over white vinyl type echoing similar unhelpful truisms.</p>
      <p>dani contributed a number of large paintings, including one of a fairytale castle. her work is generally abstract with amorphous shapes that imply figure and intimacy. </p>
      <p>we also needed to have a toy area. one very productive thrift store haul later, we knew we still needed something. specifically those wooden bead and wire sculptures/toys that are in every kid's doctor's office. but <a href="https://www.thetot.com/product/hape-original-supermaze/?tot-i18n-country=US&gclid=CjwKCAjw-ZvlBRBbEiwANw9UWkMOrQnzPVOEm7kqjcMgjSTmvD4fuV7priYGVkN9TSjSHUT0HXx0QxoC-bIQAvD_BwE">holy cow</a> were they out of our budget, so we made one.</p>
      <p>in the center of the installation, behind a bed sheet is the proverbial 'trauma center.' on one wall, there is a painting representing the internal expression of traumatic emotion and on the other a transcript of a letter from a university rejecting a sexual assault appeal with names and dates blacked out to represent how common this experience is.</p>
      <p>to brighten the mood, we made stickers inspired by lisa frank and the stickers you get after getting a shot; as well as a zine with basic information about dialectical behavioral therapy (a very helpful therapy technique about helping to manage anxiety/extreme emotion in the moment 10/10 would recommend). <a href="dbt.pdf">read the zine</a> (includes printable version)</p>
