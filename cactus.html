        <span>;-0 one of my type professors in college wanted us to put ourselves on a line between a crystal goblet or golden chalice aka minimalism vs maximalism. i got mad bc i sorted myself sorta in the middle bc i CAN do both and i got called out and told to move further to the maximal side. but now look at me, i mean who was i kidding ??? maximalism all the way. :~) don't be a coward, be a socialist. >:-) when i was a kid i wanted to be a spider scientist, but then i took biology in high school and said no thx ;^o in this house we are nice to each other <:~) </span>

      <p>i made this project in my junior typography class prompted by 'an autobiography in 6 words'. our project also had to use nontraditional type. i knew i wanted to make an installation, and after a week or two of hounding my school's administration, i got an empty room.</p>
      <p>i chose the phrase 'at least my cactus is alive' because at the time, i was an anxious, depressed, and heavily caffeinated 18 year old. basically the idea was everything else might be a mess, but at least i have a cactus (the cactus actually died a year later of some kind of soil mite lol). so, this project was basically about articulating my anxieties, in part to release my emotion and heal. to do this, i literally wrote out all of my anxieties with sharpies on lined paper then hung those on hemp string. as a viewer walks through the installation, they are surrounded by my web of anxiety.</p>
      <p>ironically, when i made the flyer for the installation opening, i got the date wrong by two months lol. i wish i had a picture of the corrected flyer, it looked like i could have made the mistake on purpose. </p>
      <p>i also made a presentational video, especially since the installation was only up a week. it is intentionally quick moving, to convey the energy of anxiety as well as obscure the written text. the video is set to <a href="https://ripursula.bandcamp.com/track/cavegrrl">cavegrrl by ursula</a> who are really good if you like punk dirges. speaking of, this installation had an accompanying playlist which i recommend because i have good taste (most of the bands have their stuff for free on bandcamp anyway).</p>
