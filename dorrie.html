      <p>dorrie sacks aka <a href="https://twitter.com/lovelydorrie">LovelyDorrie</a> is an amazingly talented eldrich digital being who is a writer (<a href="https://dorriesstories.home.blog/">read da blog !</a>), celebrity internet host on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/BeyondTheBot">youtube anime talk show</a>, and is a voice actor (she does audiobooks). she commissioned me to design her a new business card. i was inspired by magical girl anime like sailor moon and madoka magica, visuals novel games like doki doki literature club soft goth + lolita fashion, the backgrounds in earthbound, bullet hells, vaporwave, etc.  </p>
      <p>i decided to draw the entire card in pixel art using <a href="pixilart.com/draw#">pixel</a> (which ultimately corrupted my working files, so i can't give a hard rec). i've never done a whole pixel art piece, so it was a big learning experience. i learned about dithering, and next time i'd do some pattern toning instead of ummm random scribbles</p>
      <p>the logo is inspired by shojou anime titles, street art tags, retro video game titles like megaman, and ribbon. and i animated it with a bounce inspired by a game loading screen</p>
      <p>if you know magical girl anime, then you know theres a lot more under the surface than the cute outfits and sidekicks (i mean, madoka, tokyo mew mew, full moon wo sagashite, + many more, are just filled with tragedy). that's very dorrie, super cute and a little spooky. when i was designing her as a <span title="her magicalgirlsona if u will">magical girl</span>, i was keeping that in mind. i decided on a broken heart theme to reflect that good good taurus energy and also keep the lighter theme and pink palette. i also just had to include her kitties  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BpxLQw4hX_P/">pepper</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLSblxprEQ/">layla</a>.</p>
