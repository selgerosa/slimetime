        <span>;-0 one of my type professors in college wanted us to put ourselves on a line between a crystal goblet or golden chalice aka minimalism vs maximalism. i got mad bc i sorted myself sorta in the middle bc i CAN do both and i got called out and told to move further to the maximal side. but now look at me, i mean who was i kidding ??? maximalism all the way. :~) don't be a coward, be a socialist. >:-) when i was a kid i wanted to be a spider scientist, but then i took biology in high school and said no thx ;^o in this house we are nice to each other <:~) </span>

      <p>dorrie sacks who is an amazingly talented eldrich digital being who voice acts, is a writer (<a href="https://dorriesstories.home.blog/">read da blog !</a>), and celebrity internet host on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcU3qwLQ4E4t1AeCCkZg5dw">youtube anime talk show</a>. she commissioned me to design her a new business card. we were inspired by visual novels games, magical girls (u can say madoka), soft goth + lolita fashion, the backgrounds in earthbound, etc.  </p>
      <p>i decided to draw the entire card in pixel art using <a href="pixilart.com/draw#">pixel</a>, which worked pretty well. i've never done a whole pixel art piece, so it was cool to try. i learned about dithering, and next time i'd do some pattern toning instead of ummm random scribbles</p>
      <p>the logo is inspired by shojou anime titles, street art tags, and ribbon. i animated it on a bounce like a game loading screen, and i wanted to animate sparkles too, but animation is just not my calling....</p>
      <p>if you know magical girl anime, then you know theres a lot more under the surface than the cute outfits and sidekicks (i mean, madoka, tokyo mew mew, cardcaptor sakura, i could go on). that's very dorrie, super cute and a little spooky. when i was designing her as a <span title="her magicalgirlsona if u will">magical girl</span> i was keeping that in mind. i decided on a broken heart theme to reflect that good good taurus energy and also keep a solid pink theme. i also just had to include her kitties pepper and layla.</p>
