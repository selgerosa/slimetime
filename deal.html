        <span>;-0 one of my type professors in college wanted us to put ourselves on a line between a crystal goblet or golden chalice aka minimalism vs maximalism. i got mad bc i sorted myself sorta in the middle bc i CAN do both and i got called out and told to move further to the maximal side. but now look at me, i mean who was i kidding ??? maximalism all the way. :~) don't be a coward, be a socialist. >:-) when i was a kid i wanted to be a spider scientist, but then i took biology in high school and said no thx ;^o in this house we are nice to each other <:~) </span>

      <p>aka &#x1F479; aka how to deal with assholes</p>
      <p>have you ever been sitting at dinner when your racist grandpa opens his big stupid mouth? what do you do? bite your tongue and try to ignore it? leave the room? start an argument? in this book, you can find out. using a choose-your-own-adventure style narrative, the reader traverses three scenarios with assholes.  </p>
      <p>originally this book was going to be about how it sucks there aren't a lot of resources for developing interpersonal skills, especially with negative people, but really, this book is about the nuance of social interaction. even in these difficult situations, every action we make (or don't make) is a choice, for better or worse. so, sometimes you can resolve the problem, but sometimes you're the asshole. </p>
      <p>the book uses imagery from wikihow, memes, and emojis to illustrate both the physical situation and the internal feelings of the narrator. it's chaos with a grid. it was also printed and coptic stitch bound by me. </p>
